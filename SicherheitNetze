1. How many hosts can you use? How many valid IP host addresses are available?
    8 bits = 2^8 = 256
    2 bits reserved for network and broadcast adress -> 254 available adresses 
2. 64.99.1.0 mit 8 bits 
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    01000000.01100011.00000001.00000000

    255.255.255.0
    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

3. If you split the last 8 bit into network section and host section, how can you generate at least 17 subnets? Where will the 
    border between the network section and the host section be? Please represent this with bitwise numbers:
    17 can be generated with 32 -> 2^5=32
    new mask: 24 + 5 = 29
    -> 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000


        1. How many hosts can you represent in such a subnetwork?
        2^3 ( 3 empty bits) = 8
        -> 6 usable hosts (without network and broadcast adress)

        2. Please represent all valid IP-addresses in the first six subnets. Please write this up bitwise and then with decimal numbers.
        3. What are the broadcast addresses of the first six subnets. Please write them
        up in binary numbers and in decimal numbers.


Task 2
Given the following network: 123.120.10.20 with a mask of:
11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000

1. Please convert the mask into decimal numbers

255.240.0.0

The mask can be defined also by mentioning the amount of bits with the value
“1”. E.g. 141.100.10.20/24 will have a mask of
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000. 
2Please mention the mask of the given network in this way.
3 Please convert the decimal numbers into bits.
4 Which is the network part of the address? Please mention this with decimal
numbers.
5 Which networks (only in the second byte) can you distinguish? How many hosts
are available using the whole length of the host section?
6. Mention the first two networks. Which is the network part? Which hosts (only in
the second byte) can you identify? Which are the broadcast addresses of these
networks? Mention them. Take into consideration only the sec
